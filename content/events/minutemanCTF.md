## MinutemanCTF

MinutemanCTF is UMass Amherst’s annual capture the flag cybersecurity competition.  
Teams of students race to solve real world inspired security challenges in areas such as web exploitation, reverse engineering, cryptography, and forensics. The atmosphere is serious enough that you learn a lot, but friendly enough that beginners are not afraid to ask questions, fail, and try again.

## What you will learn

By the end of the event you will have:

- Hands on experience with common CTF categories  
  - Web security: broken logins, insecure cookies, basic injection patterns  
  - Reverse engineering: understanding what a binary does, finding simple vulnerabilities  
  - Cryptography: spotting mistakes in custom ciphers and protocols  
  - Forensics: digging through files, memory dumps, or network captures to recover flags
- Practice with standard tooling  
  - Linux command line, `ssh`, `grep`, `strings`, `git`  
  - Simple scripting in Python or Bash to automate boring parts
- A better mental model of how real attacks actually look in practice, not only in theory
- Experience working under light time pressure in a small, focused team

This is not a “watch a lecture and leave” kind of event. You will spend most of your time actually trying to break and fix things.

## Prerequisites

MinutemanCTF is designed so that motivated beginners can participate, while advanced students still have harder tasks to chew on.

Recommended background:

- Basic familiarity with:
  - Using a terminal on Linux or macOS  
  - Editing files, running commands, installing tools
- Very light programming experience in any language helps  
  - Being able to read small Python, C, or JavaScript snippets is a plus
- Curiosity and willingness to google, read write ups, and experiment

Not required:

- You do not need to be a “security expert”  
- You do not need prior CTF experience  
- You do not need to come with a full team; we can help match people on site

## Free food and hangout

We know deep thinking burns calories.

- Free snacks and drinks will be available during the event  
- There will be at least one bigger food break so you can reset and talk to other teams  
- The goal is that you can focus on challenges instead of running around campus searching for food

This also turns the event into a low pressure networking space. You can casually meet other students who are into security and possibly find future teammates for other competitions.

## Industry hosted lectures and mentoring

Alongside the competition, MinutemanCTF features short, focused talks from people working in the field:

- Security engineers and penetration testers  
- Researchers and graduate students with active projects  
- Alumni who now work in industry

Typical topics include:

- How CTF style problems map to real world security work  
- What an entry level security job actually looks like day to day  
- Practical advice on building a portfolio and getting internships

During breaks and after talks you will have time to ask questions:

- How to choose a security specialization  
- What skills matter most when applying  
- Which resources and practice platforms they actually recommend

These conversations are often as valuable as the competition itself, because they connect the puzzles you are solving with concrete career paths.

## Why you should come

If you are even slightly interested in cybersecurity, MinutemanCTF gives you:

- A safe environment to try offensive and defensive techniques legally  
- A clear sense of which topics you enjoy and which ones you want to study deeper  
- Real experiences you can mention in interviews and on your resume  
- A community of people at UMass who care about the same problems you do

You get hands on practice, free food, and direct contact with people who already work in the industry in a single day. That is a very good trade.
